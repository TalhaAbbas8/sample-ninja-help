### Action thresholds
These are a variety of different Action Thresholds that can be set at System level for the panel system. The system will automatically trigger notifications to any user linked to any particular Project once a threshold is passed. If the user is currently logged in the user will see instant notification in the notification center top right of the window, also an email will automatically be sent to the user. Please note that the project **email notification** - setting must be turned on to receive an email notification.

For example: **Send notifications when response rate percentage falls under particular % the system**. The system will automatically send an email to the project manager and to the assistant manager (if selected) when **Response Rate** has fallen below the configured percentage.
