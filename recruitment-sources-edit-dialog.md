### Edit recruitment source

Enter the name and cost per conversion in **reward points**. For example if $1 equals to 100 points and your recruitment cost is 50c you would enter 50 as the cost per conversion.

By default all recruitment sources are enabled. If you wish to turn one off then use the **enabled** toggle to do so.

Toggle **TUNE Enabled** if you need the recruitment survey to send conversion data back to Tune.
