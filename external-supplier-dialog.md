## Configure external supplier

### Entry link
This let's you customize the unique panelist identifier -parameter name that the supplier uses. This is mandatory parameter that is required by Sample Ninja.

### Exit links
Anything denoted in square brackets i.e. [sesskey] becomes a variable that the supplier must supply to you. Variables are there so you pass thru any URL parameter thru Sample Ninja. If the parameter is static i.e. it does not change you can just leave it text (non variable).

> If you add new identifier the entry link is automatically updated for that variable.
