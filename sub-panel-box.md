## Sub panels  

Each sub panel is its own independent community each with their own independent look and feel. At minimum you will have at least a one sub panel. Every panelist must belong to at least a one sub panel. Sub panels can be divided based on countries, regions or even membership status. While you panel has global rules like the Business Rules many other settings can be adjusted on a sub panel basis. Each sub panel can for example have their own recruitment survey, members app and security settings. You can move panelists between sub panels if desired.

> Your entire panel is deduped by using an email address. In the other words your panelists cannot signup for multiple sub panels. If you need to do this please contact us for an advice.

> Sub panel logos should be uploaded in PNG format and they should be supplied 900px x 300px size. Depending on your landing page / email template design you might want to upload a logo with a transparent background. This applies to **PNG** format only as **JPG** images don't support transparent backgrounds at all.
