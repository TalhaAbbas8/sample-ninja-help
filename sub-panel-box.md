# Sub Panels  

Each sub panel is its own independent community each with their own independent look and feel.

Click on the top buttons to configure **Email templates**, **Landing Pages** and **Settings**. Sub Panel logo can be changed simply by clicking on the logo or the upload button (if logo has not yet been uploaded).

> Sub Panel logos should be uploaded in PNG format and they should be supplied 900px x 300px size. Depending on your landing page / email template design you might want to upload logo with transparent background.
