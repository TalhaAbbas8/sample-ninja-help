### Project Quotas

On this tab you can monitor progress of your quotas. Each quota cell contains value current count vs. quota that is set. This is indicated i.e. 100/500. The progress bar displays this completion rate visually. If you mouse over the progress bar you will additionally see the number of total invites that has been sent out this far as well as the real response rate to this quota cell.

### Feasibility multiplier
This value appears after the X and indicative of your current available supply for this quota cell. If you mouse over the multiplier you will see:

- Invites needed (based on the estimated response rate for each quota cell)
- Availability (this is how many panelists are available in total)
- Estimated response rate (this is how many panelists in the past have matched with quota cell)

The feasibility multiplier is color coded. Generally speaking anything < 3 will have color coding fading from green to red. Anything in RED is indicative of imminent quota short fall.

#### Relaxing quotas

Use the toggle to relax any quotas. Basically what this means that you indicate that you allow quota overage on this cell. Typically you would want to do that if one particular quota is "dragging" down the others and it is more important that you complete the project with overage on a few cells.

#### Reload feasibility

Use the reload feasibility button to force updating the feasibility estimate. This will re-calculate feasibility with the live and up2date data. For example if you have multiple projects running at the same time the playfield can suddenly change causing potential near terms problems trying to meet the requirements for project's quota cells.
