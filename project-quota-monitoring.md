### Project Quotas

On this tab you can monitor progress of your quotas. Each quota cell contains current count and quota limit. This is indicated as number pair like 100/500. The progress bar displays this completion rate visually in this case 20%.

> By default the quota system only terminates any surveys start if your quota if full thus you may end up with slight overage. To minimize overage simplty increase the project duration. You should not attempt to complete any project with quotas under 24 hours. It is fair to assume 12 hours is reasonable expection for somebody to read their email. Therefore sort duration projects are forced to oversample which will also lead to uncessary quota terminations on entry which again leads to poor panelist experience.

### Feasibility multiplier
This value appears after the X and indicative of your current available supply for this quota cell. If you mouse over the multiplier you will see:

- Invites needed (based on the estimated response rate for each quota cell)
- Availability (this is how many panelists are available in total)
- Estimated response rate (this is how many panelists in the past have matched with quota cell)
- Estimated number of invites needed

The feasibility multiplier is color coded. Generally speaking anything < 3 will have color coding fading from green to red. Anything in RED is indicative of imminent quota short fall.

### Status column
Display the status of the column. Typically you would see arrow pointing up or down. This means balancing is taking place in the background. If you mouse over this column you will see wealth of informations what going on currently with the cell.

#### Enforcing quotas
Use the toggle to turn on/off enforce quota. By default all quotas are enforces. If you turn enforce -toggle off that basically means that you indicate that you allow unlimited quota overage on this cell.

### Status label
Visual indicator of the quota status. Statuses are:

- Active (this means this cell is sampling)
- Idle (cell on idle mode waiting for other cells to catch up)
- Cool (theoritically there is enough invites out there to close this cell. Invite trickle mode is turned on)
- Complete (Cell has been completed)

#### Reload feasibility
Use the reload feasibility button to force updating the quotas and the current feasibility estimate.
