## Rewards

This screen is for managing rewards, gift cards and redemption options that are already available within Sample Ninja.

### PayPal

PayPal integration enables you distribute cash rewards to your panelists in a very convenient way. In order to use PayPal rewards, the user will need to register a commercial developer account with PayPal.

Once the account API keys have been obtained click on the **configure** button to enter the keys. First by selecting the appropriate **Environment** and then entering the **Client ID** and **Secret required**. If everything went successfully you should see account balance(s) loaded up.

> **IMPORTANT!** In order to distribute PayPal rewards in multiple currencies you must add that funds in that currency into your account. Sample Ninja does not support currency conversions due to high fees imposed by PayPal. Once you have multiple currencies on your account you can select rewards for that currency.

#### Manage Rewards

The user can chose to **Select** the chosen currency nominations (1, 5, 10, 20, 50,100, 200, 500 and 1000), currently only available in Canadian Dollars, Euros, Great British Pounds and US Dollars.

The TangoCard integration enables you to distribute hundreds of electronic gift cards in multiple different countries. You can get started by clicking on the configure dialog.
