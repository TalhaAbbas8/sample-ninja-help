## Project Exit Links
These are the exit links where you should redirect panelist after they exit the survey. If you survey solution supports "redirect link hashing" you should always use it to prevent tampering with the links.

There are total of 5 different survey outcomes:

- Complete (Panelist has completed the survey)
- Profile (Panelist was terminated in screening questions)
- Quota (Panelist was terminated because a quota bucket was full)
- Quality (Survey has detected poor quality such as straightlining)
- Duplicate (Survey software has detected this panelist as duplicate participant)

> PLEASE NOTE THAT: No points will be issued to **Quality** and **Duplicate terminates**!
