### Panelist Manager

Find, edit and perform batch actions on individual panelists or groups of panellists.

#### Searching Panel

You can search for individual panelists by their First Name, Second Name or any wildcard combination of letters contained within these names, as well as searching by individual panelist ID or email address.

The search displays ALL matches of the search sting. If you search for a common name the screen will display the total number of panelists.

If there are more than 100 matches using a name, the search screen will only display the first 100 panelists.

#### Selecting fields
At the top right corner you have a button to change the data variables fields the are visible. You can select any number of data variables.

#### Add Filter
If you want to use query filter to find panelist you can either build a query ad hoc or pick an existing query filter saved in the Segments.

### Perform Batch action

The blue button (bottom right of screen) is only visible when AT LEAST ONE panelist is selected using the left hand check boxes.

> **IMPORTANT!** If you are using query filter then batch action is applied to all the panelists, not just the panelist who are visible on the screen!

This allows the user to Select to new subscription status for the checked panelists.  The choices are **Subscribed, Unsubscribed** or **Blacklisted**

#### Delete panelists

This allows the user to DELETE the selected panelists.    

> **WARNING - ONCE DELETED YOU CANNOT GET THE PANELIST DATA BACK**
