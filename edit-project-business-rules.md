## Project Business Rules
The panel business rules are always applied to all the project as configured in the **Panel Settings**. The business rules are displayed here for a convenience and can be edited by a user with role "Panel Manager".

> Changing **business rules** under Panel Settings will not impact already created projects. This is there to protect your live projects if somebody changes the business rules. Similarly if you use an existing saved segment as your qualification, any later mofication to the segment would not impact your project.

> The project **business rules** can be turned on/off to see the overall impact on project sample availability. You can do so in the **segment builder** by clicking on the **orange business rules** box. Please note that all projects will obey all business rules at all times and that the **business rules** cannot be turned off.
